                            <p id="bold">Had a spare section in the nav and thought I should add an about so here we go.</p>
                            <p id="bold">I bought a domain a while back for reason unknown because I can't rememeber why but I did end up proving it to be useful for things such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    First thing I ever did was make a website following a tutorial online only being a short one of which I pretty much copied every line of code to the letter BUT it worked.
                                </li>
                                <li>Then I made the most of the website adding videos and games to it so that I could play them at school.</li>
                                <li>Also managed to use the IP as a way to mask my personal IP when hosting an SMP.</li>
                                <li>Considered use for turning it into Cloud Storage and stuff but I already have services that would be far better then what I could do.</li>
                                <li>AND NOW present day where I've pretty much just tried updating the website making it look better and the such.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p id="bold">With that pretty much summing up the history of the domain zedf.co.uk apart from I guess exactly why this domain name?</p>
                            <p>
                                I went with ZEDF because I completely stole it from Soviet Womble a YouTuber I haven't watched in too long but I remember that their clan name "ZF"/"ZEDF"
                                stood for "Zero Fucks" (I think) but even if not its quite the coincidence and I guess just ever since first hearing it the almost belief completely stuck with 
                                me so thats really all the story behind it not really being a long or complex one. (I think there is a french movie titled something along the liens of Zero Fucks 
                                which I do plan on watching.)
                            </p>

                            <p id="bold">Now on the topic of Origin however you've probably seen quite the theme of the name Willow being thrown around.</p>
                            <p>
                                Simply put Willow is my online Username of which I dashed in some spice adding the 1 and 0 in place of the i and o because swag ya feel. 
                                But seriously the name comes from a celebrity and for some reason I chose to rob it and use it as my own and have done so ever since pretty much 
                                being the end of the story.
                            </p>

                            <p id="bold">Regarding the imagery you may have seen placed across the website and why those?</p>
                            <p>
                                The images I have even on this page next to w1ll0w and the main picture found on the main page are both paintings which I paid for by two seperate artists
                                where I thought I would never ever end up requiring such a service but here I am using their art everywhere I can years later being worth every penny I spent.
                                They're both paintings related to Aphrodite (being the current name for my Steam account and also the reason why they're based of Aphrodite) and then the entire 
                                reason for Aphrodite in the first place is because of a random word generator that I used a long time ago in order to find a theme for my Steam Account being 
                                something I pride myself in because for some reason on Steam NOONE DECORATES THEIR PROFILE and NOONE SPENDS THEIR STEAM POINTS making it very hard to believe that 
                                we're all descendants of those that used to use MySpace and the such so overall dissapointment but otherwise if you have Steam Points and dont use them then just
                                give them to me :DD (ALSO big Thank you to the actual artists Ash/KratKritti and Clumpsy)
                            </p>

                            <p id="bold">Now really the only thing left I can think of that needs explaining is why update the website?</p>
                            <p>
                                The entire reason was to pretty much keep me active over the summer and give myself a task not too easy but also not too difficult giving me a challenge of just 
                                the right magnitude as I know if I made myself start coding a wholeass program I wouldn't have fun with debugging and the such and give up but with web design I 
                                get to let a little bit of my inner creativity get out which really isn't a good idea because I swear my website looking ugly as hell with this strange ass colour 
                                scheme BUT best way to learn is by doing it which is another reason I thought why not do this little project over the summer.
                                But I also did learn some great skills like making use of Git, How to properly use GitHub, HTML and CSS (Screw Javascript) but overall I find it fun and Its also 
                                perfect to pop on my profiles for those that are interested, to see what I get up to being the entirety of why with this also being all I can think of that should
